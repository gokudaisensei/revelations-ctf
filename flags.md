1. **Blueprint Blunder (General Skills):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{X_RAY_EXPOSES_MOUSE}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* The flag references the X-ray revealing something about the mouse inside Tom.

2. **Triple-Wrapped Cheese-nigma (General Skills):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{NESTED_CHEESE_SECRETS}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* The flag hints at a "nested" series of Base64 encodings protecting the "Special Reserve Cheddar."

3. **Rotisserie Recipe Robbery (Cryptography):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{ROT13_RECOVERED_RAT_RECIPE}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* This flag plays on the fact that a ROT13 cipher was used to scramble Tom’s cherished recipe for Rotisserie Roasted Rat.

4. **Bulldog Biscuit Bonanza (Cryptography):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{BISCUIT_FORTRESS_CRACKED}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* This flag reflects that Spike’s Biscuit Fortress™ has been “cracked” by deciphering the Vigenère-encrypted code.

5. **The robots.txt Rescue (Web Exploitation):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{ROBOTS_HINT_REVEALS_ADMIN}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* This flag implies that examining the robots.txt file revealed the hidden admin page where the flag is stored.

6. **Cookie Corruption (Web Exploitation):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{COOKIE_SYSTEM_COMPROMISED}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* This flag signals that Tom’s cookie system has been compromised, giving Jerry (or the attacker) elevated privileges.

7. **Strings of Sausage (Reverse Engineering):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{SAUSAGE_STRINGS_REVEALED}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* This flag indicates that the hidden secret within the binary’s string data (the sausage) has been uncovered.

8. **Cracking Tom's Trap Code (Reverse Engineering):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{TOMS_TRAP_BROKEN}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* This flag shows that the password within Tom’s trap has been successfully cracked, disabling his trap.

9. **The Format String Funhouse (Binary Exploitation):**  
   *Flag:*  

   ```
   FLAG{CHEESE_CATALOG_COMPROMISED}
   ```  

   *Rationale:* This flag reflects that Jerry’s exploitation of the format string vulnerability in the cheese catalog printer has revealed the flag.

10. **The Shell Escape (Binary Exploitation):**  
    *Flag:*  

    ```
    FLAG{MOUSE_TRAP_OVERRIDDEN}
    ```  

    *Rationale:* This flag indicates that the buffer overflow has been successfully exploited to override Tom’s trap, allowing an escape shell to be spawned.

Each flag is designed to be both thematic and descriptive of the challenge’s objective. You can adjust the text to fit your event’s narrative even better if needed.
